## Hi, I'm otmojo 👋

I’m a software engineer interested in how **media systems** work at scale.

Rather than focusing on surface-level features, I’m curious about the **infrastructure and system design** behind:
- high-traffic ad delivery
- data-intensive pipelines
- systems that need to be both **fast and reliable**

I try to understand not only *how* systems are built, but *why* certain trade-offs are made.

---

### Technical background

- Backend development (Java / Python / JavaScript)
- Web application development
- SQL-based data access and basic data processing
- Experience working with APIs and production systems

I value clear system design, readable code, and long-term maintainability.
