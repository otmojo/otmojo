## Hi, I'm otmojo 👋

I'm a software engineer focused on backend systems and infrastructure, especially in environments where performance, reliability, and data volume matter.

I'm interested in how large-scale systems actually work in production — from request handling and data pipelines to service coordination and operational trade-offs.

Rather than chasing surface features, I focus on:

- building reliable backend services
- designing clear system boundaries
- understanding performance bottlenecks
- making engineering trade-offs explicit

---

### Technical focus

- Backend development: Java / Python / JavaScript
- REST APIs and service-oriented systems
- SQL-based data access and basic data pipelines
- Production debugging and system behavior analysis

Currently learning more about:

- concurrency and synchronization
- system performance (latency / throughput)
- data consistency and failure modes

---

### Engineering values

- simple architectures over clever abstractions  
- observable systems over hidden magic  
- maintainable code over premature optimization  

I care about understanding *why* systems are designed a certain way, not just how to implement them.
